Although most of The Beatles' songs were written by [[Lennon–McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], Beatle albums generally included one or two of Harrison's own songs, from ''[[With The Beatles]]'' onwards.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/01/11/harrison-lyrics-auction.html Handwritten Harrison Beatles lyrics up for auction], CBC Arts, 11 January 2007. Retrieved 13 December 2008.</ref> His later compositions with The Beatles include "[[Here Comes the Sun]]", "[[Something]]" and "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]". By the time of [[The Beatles' break-up|the band's break-up]], Harrison had accumulated a backlog of material, which he then released as the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' in 1970, from which two hit singles originated: a double A-side single, "[[My Sweet Lord]]" backed with "[[Isn't It a Pity]]", and "[[What Is Life]]". In addition to his solo work, Harrison co-wrote two hits for former Beatle [[Ringo Starr]], as well as songs for the [[Traveling Wilburys]]—the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] he formed in 1988 with [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Roy Orbison]].

Harrison embraced [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and [[Hinduism]] in the mid-1960s, and helped expand Western awareness of [[sitar]] music and of the [[Hare Krishna movement]]. With [[Ravi Shankar]] he organised the first major charity concert with the 1971 ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]]''. In addition to his musical accomplishments, he was also a record producer and co-founder of the production company [[HandMade Films]]. In his work as a film producer, he collaborated with people as diverse as the members of [[Monty Python]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handmadeplc.com/ |title=HandMade PLC|publisher=www.handmadeplc.com |accessdate=30 October 2008 |last= |first=}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

He was married twice, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] from 1966 to 1974, and for 23 years to record company secretary [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Trinidad Arias]], with whom he had one son, [[Dhani Harrison]]. He was a close friend of [[Eric Clapton]]. To date, he is the only Beatle to have published an autobiography, with ''[[I Me Mine (book)|I Me Mine]]'' in 1980. Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001.

==Early years: 1943–1959==
Harrison was born in [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]], England, on 25 February 1943,<!-- Read the footnote before changing this date, and then DO NOT CHANGE IT!! --><ref name="harryp492"/><ref>Reliable sources and his birth certificate show his birth date as 25 February, though some sources give 24 February.</ref> the last of four children to Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his wife Louise, née French.<ref>Miles and Badman, ''The Beatles' Diary'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_TBkf1ttNBYC&pg=PA6 p. 6].</ref>

His mother was a Liverpool shop assistant, and his father was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the [[White Star Line]]. His mother's family had [[Irish people|Irish]] roots and were [[Roman Catholic]];<ref name="harryp492">Harry, ''The Beatles' Encyclopedia'', p. 492.</ref> his maternal grandfather, John French, was born in [[County Wexford]], Ireland, emigrating to Liverpool where he married a local girl, Louise Woollam.<ref name="beatlesireland">{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~beatlesireland/Irish%20Heritage/georgeheritage.html |title=Beatles Ireland – George Harrison Irish Heritage |publisher=Beatles Ireland |accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>

Harrison was born in the house where he lived for his first six years: [[12 Arnold Grove]], [[Wavertree]], Liverpool, which was a small 2 up, 2 down [[terraced house]] in a cul-de-sac, with an alley to the rear. The only heating was a single coal fire, and the toilet was outside. In 1950 the family were offered a [[council house]],<ref>Ingham, ''Rough Guide to the Beatles'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=htl2U1fPq8QC&pg=PA328 p. 328].</ref> and moved to 25 Upton Green, [[Speke]].<ref>Miles and Badman, ''The Beatles' Diary'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_TBkf1ttNBYC&pg=PA7 p. 7].</ref>

His first school was [[Dovedale Primary School]], very close to [[Penny Lane]],<ref>Harrison, ''I Me Mine'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=FtF&q=%22george%20harrison%22%20Dovedale%20Road%20Infants%20%26%20Juniors%20School&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tab=wp p. 28].</ref> the same school as [[John Lennon]] who was a couple of years ahead of him.<ref>Frame, ''Rockin' Around Britain'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GHPVGbDS0KsC&pg=PT84 p. 73].</ref> He passed his [[11-plus]] examination and achieved a place at the [[Liverpool Institute for Boys]] (in the building that now houses the [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]]), which he attended from 1954 to 1959.<ref>Giuliano, ''Dark Horse'', p. 9.</ref>

Harrison said that, when he was 12 or 13, he had an "epiphany" of sorts – riding a bike around his neighbourhood, he heard [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]" playing from a nearby house and was hooked.<ref name="George Harrison school life">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/george-harrison/person/3479/trivia.html|title=George Harrison school life | accessdate=4 July 2009}}</ref> Even though he had done well enough on his 11-plus examination to get into the city's best high school, from that point on, the former good student lost interest in school.<ref name="George Harrison school life"/>

When Harrison was 14 years old, he sat at the back of the class and tried drawing guitars in his schoolbooks: “I was totally into guitars. I heard about this kid at school who had a guitar at [[Coins of the pound sterling#System|£3 10s]], it was just a little acoustic round hole. I got the £3 10s from my mother: that was a lot of money for us then.” Harrison bought a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar.<ref name="BeatlesBrowserFourp3">{{cite web|url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/beatlesbrowser-four3.shtml |title=Beatles Browser Four (p3) |first=Bill |last=Harry |work=Mersey Beat |accessdate=4 July 2009}}</ref> While at the Liverpool Institute, Harrison formed a [[skiffle]] group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend, [[Arthur Kelly]].<ref name="Peter Harrison">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2106466.ece |title=Lives in Brief: Peter Harrison |date=20 July 2007 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=22 July 2007 |location=London |first=Sadie |last=Gray}}</ref> At this school he met [[Paul McCartney]], who was one year older.<ref>Shapiro, ''Behind Sad Eyes'', p. 23.</ref> McCartney later became a member of John Lennon's band called [[The Quarrymen]], which Harrison joined in 1958.<ref>Miles, ''The Beatles' Diary: An Intimate Day by Day History'', p. 18.</ref>

After he revealed in an interview that he liked [[jelly babies]], British fans inundated Harrison and the rest of the band with boxes of the sweets as gifts. A few months later, American audiences showered the band with the much harder [[jelly beans]] instead. In a letter to a fan, Harrison mentioned jelly babies, insisting that no one in the band actually liked them and that the press must have made it up.<ref name="Beatlesautographs">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://beatlesautographs.com/george_harrison.htm |title=A George Harrison Handwritten Letter to a Fan, August 1963 |publisher=Beatles Autographs |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref>

The popularity of The Beatles led to a successful tour of America, the making of a film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (during which Harrison met his future wife [[Pattie Boyd]]), and in the 1965 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]], all four Beatles were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=43667 |supp=yes |startpage=5487 |date=4 June 1965 |accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref> Harrison, whose role within the group was that of the careful musician who checked that the instruments were tuned,<ref>Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' 2003, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjY3kg2umEQC&pg=PA12 p. 13].</ref> by 1965 and the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album, was developing into a musical director as he led the others into folk-rock, via his interest in [[The Byrds]] and [[Bob Dylan]],<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=eAvWzih4zEEC&pg=PA180 ''Turn!

During the recording of ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' in 1968, tensions were present in the band;<ref>Babiuk, Lewisohn, and Bacon, ''Beatles Gear'',[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zQ-5ZpoMn1AC&pg=PA217 p. 217].</ref> these surfaced again during the filming of rehearsal sessions at [[Twickenham Studios]] for the album ''[[Let It Be]]'' in early 1969. Frustrated by ongoing slights, the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio, and Lennon's creative disengagement from the group, Harrison quit the band on 10 January. He returned on 22 January after negotiations with the other Beatles at two business meetings.<ref name="sulpy">{{Cite book|first=Doug |last=Sulpy |coauthors=Schweighardt, Ray |title=Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of The Beatles' Let It Be Disaster |publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=1-900924-83-8}}</ref>

Relations among The Beatles were more cordial (though still strained) during recordings for the album ''[[Abbey Road]]''.<ref>Miles and Badman, ''The Beatles Diary'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_TBkf1ttNBYC&pg=PA354 p. 354].</ref> The album included "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" and "[[Something]]", "Something" was later recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]], who considered it "the greatest love song of the past fifty years".<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nF_Ln3WxuBYC&pg=PA38 ''Frank Sinatra: The Man, the Music, the Legend''], p. 38, Jeanne Fuchs, Ruth Prigozy, Boydell & Brewer, 2007, ISBN 1-58046-251-0.</ref> Harrison's increasing productivity, coupled with his difficulties in getting The Beatles to record his music, meant that by the end of the group's career he had amassed a considerable stockpile of unreleased material.<ref name="Sonic"/> Harrison's last recording session with The Beatles was on 4 January 1970.

==Relationships with the other Beatles==
For most of The Beatles career, the relationships in the group were extremely close and intimate. According to [[Hunter Davies]], "The Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends." Harrison's wife [[Pattie Boyd]] described how The Beatles "all belonged to each other" and admitted, "George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it."<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393315711 Amazon.com].</ref>

Ringo Starr also stated, "We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other." and added "There were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational."<ref>{{cite web |title=Amazon.co.uk |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date=  |id={{ASIN|0304356050|country=uk}}}}</ref>

John Lennon stated that his relationship with George was "one of young follower and older guy", and admitted that "[George] was like a disciple of mine when we started."<ref>[http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1980.jlpb.beatles.html BeatlesInterviews.org].</ref> The two would often go on holiday together throughout the 1960s. Their relationship took a severe turn for the worse after George published his autobiography, ''I Me Mine''. Lennon felt insulted and hurt that George mentioned him only in passing. Actually, the book mentions John 11 times, which is higher than the number of mentions received by Paul, The Beatles, Eric Clapton or even George's second wife, Olivia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1072271/Lennons-downfall-Had-touching-act-love-alive-today.html#ixzz1rqY2nAcO |title=Lennon's downfall: Had it not been for one last touching act of love, he might still be alive today |date= |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>
Nevertheless, Lennon claimed he was hurt by the book and also that he did more for George than any of the other Beatles. As a result, George and John were not on good terms during the last months of Lennon's life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.john-lennon.com/playboyinterviewwithjohnlennonandyokoono.htm |title=1980 Playboy Interview With John Lennon And Yoko Ono by David Sheff |publisher=John-Lennon.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2010}}</ref> After Lennon's murder, George paid tribute to Lennon with his song "[[All Those Years Ago]]" which was released in 1981, six months after Lennon's murder. It contains the lyric "I always look up to you", suggesting implicit agreement with Lennon's appraisal of their relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/All-Those-Years-Ago-lyrics-George-Harrison/3D9E1438D16592E04825695E001CE4CF |title=All Those Years Ago lyrics |publisher=Sing365.com |date= |accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref>

Paul McCartney has often referred to Harrison as his "baby brother",<ref>{{cite web|author=Published 7/4/08 by |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1030566_Sir_Paul_McCartney_says_George_Harrison_was_like_his_baby_brother |title=TheInsider.com |publisher=TheInsider.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> and he did the honours as best man at George's wedding in 1966. The two were the first of The Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and would often learn and rehearse new guitar chords together. McCartney stated that he and George usually shared a bedroom while touring.<ref>[http://taz4158.tripod.com/macint.htm Tripod.com].</ref>

===Guitar work===
Although not fast or flashy, Harrison's guitar work with The Beatles was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag122/feature122.html

During The Beatles' trip to the US in 1964, Harrison acquired a [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] guitar. He had tried out the 12-string electric guitar during an interview with a Minneapolis radio station, and was given the guitar either by the Rickenbacker company or the radio station.<ref>''The History of Rickenbacker Guitars'', pp. 77–79, Richard R. Smith, Centerstream Publications, 1988, ISBN 0-931759-15-3.</ref> The 360/12 was an experimental [[12-string]] guitar with the strings reversed so that the lower pitched string was struck first, and with an unusual [[headstock]] design that made tuning easier.<ref name="Beatles Gear">Babiuk, Lewisohn, and Bacon, ''Beatles Gear'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zQ-5ZpoMn1AC&pg=PA112 pp. 110–112].</ref> Harrison used the guitar extensively during the recording of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'',<ref>[http://www.fretbase.com/blog/2009/05/george-harrisons-12-string-rickenbacker/ Fretbase, George Harrison's 12 String Rickenbacker].</ref> and the jangly sound became so popular that the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' termed it "the beat boys' secret weapon".<ref>Babiuk, Lewisohn, and Bacon, ''Beatles Gear'', p. 120.</ref> [[Roger McGuinn]] liked the effect Harrison achieved so much that it became his signature guitar sound with [[the Byrds]].<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MiAUF0ea64UC&pg=PT15 ''Christie's Rock and Pop Memorabilia''], p. 82, Peter Doggett, Sarah Hodgson, Pavilion, 2003, ISBN 1-86205-538-6.</ref>

He obtained his first [[Fender Stratocaster]] in 1965 and used it for the recording of the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album, most notably on the "[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]" track, where he played in unison with Lennon who also had a Stratocaster.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EeEctAKFUWAC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=Fender+Stratocaster+george+harrison+Don+Randall ''The Fender Stratocaster''], p. 22, A.

===Song writing and singing===
{{Main|List of George Harrison songs}}
Harrison wrote his first song published with the Beatles, "Don't Bother Me", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as "an exercise to see if I ''could'' write a song", [emphasis in original] as he remembered.<ref>Harrison, George. ''I Me Mine'' (1980) p. 84</ref> "Don't Bother Me" appeared on the second Beatles album ''[[With The Beatles]]'' later that year, then on ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' in the US in early 1964, and also briefly in the film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. The group did not record another Harrison composition until 1965, when he contributed "[[I Need You (The Beatles song)|I Need You]]" and "[[You Like Me Too Much]]" to the album ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]''. One of his more enduring early works is 1965's "[[If I Needed Someone]]".

Harrison's songwriting improved greatly through the years, but his material did not earn respect from his fellow Beatles until near the group's break-up. McCartney told Lennon in 1969: "Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours".<ref>''Miles (1997) p. 554.</ref><ref>''John Lennon: One Day at a Time: a Personal Biography of the Seventies'', p. 96, Anthony Fawcett, New English Library, 20 January 1977, ISBN 0-450-03073-3.</ref> Harrison had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.<ref>''Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends who Changed Music Forever'', p. 174, Scott Schinder, Greenwood Press, 2008, ISBN 0-313-33846-9.</ref><ref>''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll: Revised and Updated for the 21st Century'', p. 413, Holly George-Warren, Patricia Romanowski, Patricia Romanowski Bashe, Jon Pareles, Fireside, 2001, ISBN 0-7432-0120-5.</ref> The group's incorporation of Harrison's material reached a peak of three songs on the 1966 ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]'' album and four songs on the 1968 double ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]''.

Harrison performed the lead vocal on all Beatles songs that he wrote by himself. He also sang lead vocal on other songs, including "[[Chains (song)|Chains]]" and "[[Do You Want to Know a Secret]]" on ''[[Please Please Me]]'', "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" and "[[Devil in Her Heart]]" on ''[[With The Beatles]]'', "[[I'm Happy Just to Dance with You]]" on ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', and "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]" on ''[[Beatles for Sale]]''.

==Solo work: 1968–1987==
Before The Beatles split up in 1970, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' and ''[[Electronic Sound]]''. These albums were mainly instrumental. ''Wonderwall Music'' was a soundtrack to the ''[[Wonderwall (film)|Wonderwall]]'' film in which Harrison blended Indian and Western sounds;<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA182&dq=Wonderwall+Music ''The Dawn of Indian Music in the West''], p. 182, Peter Lavezzoli, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, ISBN 0-8264-1815-5</ref> while ''Electronic Sound'' was an experiment in using a [[Moog synthesizer|Moog synthesiser]].<ref name="amg-rock-508">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bgn9SGmA4dkC&pg=PA508&dq=electronic+sound+george+harrison ''All Music Guide to Rock''], p. 508, Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Backbeat Books, 2002, ISBN 0-87930-653-X</ref> It was only when Harrison was free from The Beatles that he released what is regarded as his first "real" solo album, the commercially successful and critically acclaimed ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''.<ref name="Boys">Schaffner, ''The Boys from Liverpool'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iJ0OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA155&dq=george+harrison+Solo+career p 155].</ref>

===''All Things Must Pass'' (1970)===
{{Main|All Things Must Pass}}
After years of being restricted in his song-writing contributions to the Beatles, ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' contained such a large outpouring of Harrison's songs that it was released as a [[triple album]],<ref name="Boys"/> though only two of the discs contained songs—the third contained recordings of Harrison [[Jam session|jamming]] with friends.<ref name="Sonic">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y4Sk0FNXkjcC&pg=PA36&dq=All+Things+Must+Pass+harrison+success#PPA37,M1 ''Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings''], pp 36 – 37, David N.

Because some sales were not properly counted, the album originally peaked at number four in Britain.

The album was co-produced by [[Phil Spector]] using his "[[Wall of Sound]]" approach,<ref>Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', p 142.</ref> and the musicians included [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Mason]], [[Gary Wright]], [[Billy Preston]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="Sonic"/>

Harrison was later sued for [[copyright infringement]] over the song "My Sweet Lord" because of its similarity to the 1963 [[The Chiffons|Chiffons]] song "[[He's So Fine]]", owned by Bright Tunes. Harrison denied deliberately plagiarising the song, but he lost the resulting court case in 1976 as the judge deemed that Harrison had "subconsciously" plagiarised "He's So Fine". When considering liable earnings, "My Sweet Lord"'s contribution to the sales of ''All Things Must Pass'' and ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' were taken into account, and the judge decided a figure of $1,599,987 was owed to Bright Tunes.<ref name="Plagiarism">[http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/mysweet.htm The "My Sweet Lord"/"He's So Fine" Plagiarism Suit], Joseph C. Self, The 910, 1993. Retrieved 13 December 2008.</ref> The dispute over damages became complicated when Harrison's former manager [[Allen Klein]] purchased the copyright to "He's So Fine" from Bright Tunes in 1978. In 1981, a district judge decided that Klein had acted improperly, and it was agreed that Harrison should pay Klein $587,000, the amount Klein had paid for "He's So Fine", so he would gain nothing from the deal, and that Harrison would take over ownership of Bright Tunes, making him the owner of the rights to both "My Sweet Lord" and "He's So Fine" and thus ending the copyright infringement claim. Though the dispute dragged on into the 1990s, the district judge's decision was upheld.<ref name="Plagiarism"/><ref name="huntley">Huntley, ''Mystical One''.</ref>

===The Concert for Bangladesh (1971)===
{{Main|The Concert for Bangladesh}}
Responding to a request for help by longtime friend [[Ravi Shankar]], Harrison organised a major charity concert, ''The Concert for Bangladesh'', on 1 August 1971, drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="ConcertforBangladesh">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.concertforbangladesh.com/ |title=Concert for Bangladesh |publisher=Concertforbangladesh |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref> The aim of the event was to raise money to aid the starving refugees during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. Ravi Shankar opened the proceedings, which included other popular musicians such as [[Bob Dylan]] (who rarely appeared live in the early 1970s), [[Eric Clapton]], who made his first public appearance in months (due to a heroin addiction which began when [[Derek and the Dominos]] broke up), [[Leon Russell]], [[Badfinger]], [[Billy Preston]] and fellow Beatle [[Ringo Starr]]. Tax troubles and questionable expenses tied up many of the concert's proceeds.<ref name="ConcertforBangladesh"/> Apple Corporation released a newly arranged concert DVD and CD in October 2005 (with all artists' sales royalties continuing to go to [[UNICEF]]), which contained additional material such as previously unreleased rehearsal footage of "[[If Not for You]]", featuring Harrison and Dylan.

===''Living in the Material World'' to ''George Harrison'' (1972–1979)===
Harrison would not again release an album that came close to the critical and commercial achievements of ''All Things Must Pass''. Although 1973's ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' initially did well, holding number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks and reaching number two in the UK, and the album's single, "[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]", was also successful, reaching number one in the US and the top ten in the UK, neither could match the sales of ''All Things Must Pass'' and "My Sweet Lord". The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was the power of Harrison's Hindu beliefs.<ref name="tbf-159">Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', pp 158–159.</ref> The one fully secular song, "[[Sue Me, Sue You Blues]]", expressed Harrison's disgust with the endless legal squabbling that had overtaken all of the former Beatles.<ref name="tbf-159"/> The ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' album of 1974 written after Harrison's break-up with his wife [[Pattie Boyd]] and when he was suffering from [[laryngitis]] received harsh reviews,<ref>Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' 2003, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZjY3kg2umEQC&pg=PA118 pp 111–112].</ref> as did the accompanying tour of North America. Harrison was criticised for poor songwriting and poor vocals on the album, and for over-indulging his love for Indian music during the tour.<ref>Greene, ''Here Comes the Sun'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BSZtZUWge-IC&pg=PA213&dq=george+harrison+tour+of+the+United+States+in+1974 p 213].</ref> The album and single "[[Dark Horse (song)|Dark Horse]]" did briefly make an appearance near the top of the US charts, but both failed to chart in the UK.<ref>

His final studio album for EMI (and Apple Records) was ''[[Extra Texture (Read All About It)]]'', featuring a [[die cutting (web)|diecut]] cover. The album spawned two singles, "[[You (George Harrison song)|You]]" which reached the Billboard top 20 and "[[This Guitar (Can't Keep From Crying)]]", which became Apple's final original single release in December 1975.<ref>Schaffner ''The Beatles Forever'', pp. 209–210.</ref> Following the former Beatle's departure from Capitol, the record company was in a position to license releases featuring Beatles and post-Beatles work on the same album, using Harrison for this experiment.<ref>Nicholas Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', McGraw-Hill (New York, NY, 1978), p. 188.</ref> ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' (1976) combined his Beatles songs with a selection of his solo Apple work.

''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'', his first Dark Horse release, was his most successful late-1970s album, reaching number 11 on the US charts in 1976, and producing the singles "[[This Song]]" (a satire of the "[[My Sweet Lord]]"-"[[He's So Fine]]" court case ruling) and "[[Crackerbox Palace]]", both of which reached the top 25 in the US. With an emphasis on melody, musicianship, and subtler subject matter rather than the heavy orchestration and didactic messaging of earlier works, he received his best critical notices since ''All Things Must Pass''.<ref name="tbf-192">Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', p 192.</ref> With its [[surreal humour]], "Crackerbox Palace" also reflected Harrison's association with [[Monty Python]]'s [[Eric Idle]], who directed a comic music video for the song.<ref name="tbf-192"/> After his second marriage and the birth of son [[Dhani Harrison]], Harrison's next released a self-titled album. 1979's ''[[George Harrison (album)|George Harrison]]'' included the singles "[[Blow Away]]", "[[Love Comes to Everyone]]" and "[[Faster (George Harrison song)|Faster]]". Both the album and "Blow Away" made the Billboard top 20.

In addition to his own works during this time, between 1971 and 1973 Harrison co-wrote or produced three top ten US and UK hits for Ringo Starr ("[[It Don't Come Easy]]", "[[Back Off Boogaloo]]", and "[[Photograph (Ringo Starr song)|Photograph]]").<ref>Schaffner, ''The Boys from Liverpool'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iJ0OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA164&dq=george+harrison+%22it+don%27t++come+easy%22 p 164].</ref> Harrison played electric, slide and [[dobro]] guitars on five songs on John Lennon's 1971 ''[[Imagine (album)|Imagine]]'' album ("[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?]]", "[[Oh My Love]]", "[[I Don't Want to Be a Soldier]]", "[[Crippled Inside]]" and "[[Gimme Some Truth]]"),<ref name="wmggw-109">Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' 2006, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NRoFPFvI1joC&pg=PA108 pp 108–109].</ref> with his stinging slide guitar work on the first of these indicating that he took John's side of the intense Lennon-McCartney feud of the time.<ref>Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', p 145.</ref> Lennon later said of Harrison's work on the album, "That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life!"<ref name="wmggw-109"/> Harrison also produced and played slide guitar on the Apple band [[Badfinger]]'s 1971 top ten US and UK hit "[[Day After Day (song)|Day After Day]]".<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eAURGSMNfTUC&pg=PA136&dq=george+harrison+%22Day+After+Day%22&as_pt=ALLTYPES ''Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger''], p 136, Dan Matovina, Frances Glover Books, 2000, ISBN 0-9657122-2-2</ref>

During the decade, Harrison also worked with [[Harry Nilsson]] ("You're Breakin' My Heart", 1972),<ref>Shapiro, ''Behind Sad Eyes'', p 219.</ref> as well as [[Billy Preston]] ("[[That's the Way God Planned It]]",<ref>Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' 2006, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NRoFPFvI1joC&pg=PA59 p 59].</ref> 1969 and "[[It's My Pleasure]]", 1975) and [[Cheech & Chong]] ("[[Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces|Basketball Jones]]", 1973).<ref>Shapiro, ''Behind Sad Eyes'', p 220.</ref> He also appeared with [[Paul Simon]] to perform two acoustic songs on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

===''Somewhere in England'' to ''Cloud Nine'' (1980–1987)===
Harrison was deeply shocked by the 8 December 1980 [[Death of John Lennon|murder of John Lennon]].<ref name="harryGHp247">Harry, ''The George Harrison Encyclopedia'', p 247.</ref> The crime reinforced his decades-long worries about safety from [[stalking|stalkers]]. It was also a deep personal loss, although unlike former bandmates McCartney and Starr, Harrison had little contact with Lennon in the years before the murder. Their estrangement had been marked by Harrison's longstanding dislike of Yoko Ono, his refusal to allow her participation in the ''Concert for Bangladesh'', and his omission of any mention of Lennon in his autobiography, ''I Me Mine'', published the year of Lennon's murder.<ref name="harryGHp246">Harry, ''The George Harrison Encyclopedia'', p 246.</ref> The omission had upset Lennon greatly, which Harrison had regretted, leading him to leave a telephone message for Lennon, but Lennon had declined to return the call and they had not spoken again.<ref name="harryGHp247" /> Following the murder, Harrison said, "After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon. I am shocked and stunned. To rob life is the ultimate robbery in life."<ref name="harryGHp247" />

Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon. "[[All Those Years Ago]]" received substantial radio airplay, reaching number two on the US charts.<ref name="AllThoseYearsAgo">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.connollyco.com/discography/george_harrison/allthose7.html |title=All Those Years Ago |publisher=Connolly and Company |accessdate=5 May 2008}}</ref> All three surviving ex-Beatles performed on it, although it was expressly a Harrison single. "Teardrops" was issued as a follow-up single, but was not nearly as successful. Both singles came from the album ''[[Somewhere in England]]'', released in 1981. Originally slated for release in late 1980, [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] rejected the album, ordering Harrison to replace several tracks, and to change the album cover as well. The original album cover that Harrison wanted was used in the 2004 reissue of the album. In 1981, Harrison played guitar on one track of [[Mick Fleetwood]]'s record ''The Visitor'' and [[Lindsey Buckingham]]'s song "Walk a Thin Line".

Aside from a song on the ''[[Porky's Revenge]]'' soundtrack in 1985 (his version of a little-known [[Bob Dylan]] song "[[I Don't Want to Do It]]"), Harrison released no new records for five years after 1982's ''[[Gone Troppo]]'' received apparent indifference.

In October 1985, Harrison made a rare public appearance on the [[Cinemax]] [[Channel 4]] live concert TV special in a tribute to [[Carl Perkins]]. He appeared along with [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Eric Clapton]] among others. The show was called ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]''. He performed "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]", "Your True Love", "[[That's Alright Mama]]" (including the guitar solo), "[[Glad All Over]]" (including the guitar solo), "Gone Gone Gone" and "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]". He only agreed to appear because he had been a close admirer and friend of Carl Perkins for over 20 years.

In 1987, Harrison returned with the critically acclaimed platinum album ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'', co-produced with [[Jeff Lynne]] of [[Electric Light Orchestra]], and enjoyed a hit (number one in the US; number two in the UK) when his rendition of [[James Ray (singer)|James Ray's]] early 1960s number "[[Got My Mind Set on You]]" was released as a single; another single, "[[When We Was Fab]]", a retrospective of The Beatles' days complete with musical flavours for each bandmate, was also a minor hit. MTV regularly played the two videos, and elevated Harrison's public profile with another generation of music listeners. The album reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts, respectively. In the US, several tracks also enjoyed high placement on Billboard's Album Rock chart – "Devil's Radio", "[[This Is Love (George Harrison song)|This Is Love]]" and "Cloud 9" in addition to the aforementioned singles.

On 23 November 1971, Harrison appeared on an episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' in a band called Wonder Wheel performing a song written by [[Gary Wright]] called "Two Faced Man". Harrison played slide guitar in this band as a favour since Wright had played piano on Harrison's album ''All Things Must Pass''. The episode can be viewed on DVD ''The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons'' Disc 3.<ref name="BiographyGaryWright">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/music/artists/gary_wright/ |title=Biography: Gary Wright |publisher=Absolute Radio |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref>

Harrison launched a major tour of the United States in 1974. Critical and fan reaction panned the tour for its long mid-concert act of Pandit Ravi Shankar & Friends and for Harrison's hoarse voice.
Harrison had hired filmmaker [[David Acomba]] to accompany the tour and gather footage for a documentary. Due to Harrison's hoarse voice throughout most of this tour, the film was not released, but in 1977 Acomba placed a newly revised director's cut in the Harrison archive. It was the last time he toured in the United States.

In 1986, Harrison made a surprise performance at the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]] a concert event to raise money for the [[Birmingham Children's Hospital]]. Harrison played and sang the finale "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" along with [[Robert Plant]], [[The Moody Blues]], and [[Electric Light Orchestra]], among others.<ref name="ShadowsoftheLight ">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.rockaria.com/history.html |title=Shadows of the Light |publisher=Rockaria |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref> The following year, Harrison appeared at [[The Prince's Trust]] concert in [[Wembley Arena]], performing "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" and "Here Comes the Sun" with Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, and others.<ref>Ingham, ''Rough Guide to The Beatles'', p 159.</ref> On 1 May 1990, during [[Eric Clapton]]'s Journey Man Tour, Harrison joined Clapton on stage at the L.A.

It was his first tour since the 1974 US tour, but no other tours followed. The ''[[Live in Japan (George Harrison album)|Live in Japan]]'' recording came from these shows.

On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the [[Natural Law Party]] at [[Royal Albert Hall]], his first London performance in 23 years<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/george-harrison-729550.html |title=George Harrison |work=The Independent |last=Welch |first=Chris |date=1 December 2001 |accessdate=23 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref> and his last full concert.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In October 1992, Harrison performed three songs, "[[If Not for You]]", "[[Absolutely Sweet Marie]]", and "[[My Back Pages]]", at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.<ref name="Bob DylanInductionYear">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/bob-dylan |title=Bob Dylan: Induction Year: 1988 |work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref> This was released on the album ''[[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration]]'' in August 1993.

On 14 December 1992, Harrison took part in a memorial concert at the [[Universal Amphitheater]] in Los Angeles for [[Toto (band)|Toto]] drummer [[Jeff Porcaro]]. The concert consisted of an all-star line-up that included [[Boz Scaggs]], [[Donald Fagen]], [[Don Henley]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[David Crosby]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], and the members of Toto. The proceeds of the concert were used to establish an educational trust fund for Porcaro's children.<ref>Harry, ''The George Harrison Encyclopedia'', p 106.</ref>

==Later life: 1988–2001==
Early in 1989, Harrison, Lynne and Ringo Starr all appeared in the music video for [[Tom Petty]]'s "I Won't Back Down", although Starr did not actually play on the track; Harrison played acoustic guitar. The same year also saw the release of ''[[Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989]]'', a compilation drawn from his later solo work. This album also included two new songs, "Poor Little Girl", and "Cockamamie Business" (which saw him once again looking wryly upon his Beatle past), as well as "[[Cheer Down]]", which had first been released earlier in the year on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', which starred [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Danny Glover]]. Unlike his previous greatest hits package, Harrison made sure to oversee this compilation. In 1989 Harrison played slide guitar on the "[[Leave a Light On]]" and "Deep Deep Ocean" songs from [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s third album ''[[Runaway Horses (album)|Runaway Horses]]''. "Leave a Light On" was successful worldwide.

In 1996, Harrison recorded, produced and played on "Distance Makes No Difference With Love" with [[Carl Perkins]] for his ''Go-Cat-Go'' record.

Harrison's final television appearance was not intended as such; in fact, he was not the featured artist, and the appearance had been intended to promote ''Chants of India'', another collaboration with Ravi Shankar released in 1997, at the height of interest in [[chant]] music. [[John Fugelsang]], then of [[VH1]], conducted the interview, and at one point an acoustic guitar was produced and handed to Harrison. When an audience member asked to hear "a Beatles song", Harrison pulled a sheepish look and answered, "I don't think I know any!" Harrison then played "All Things Must Pass" and revealed for the first time "Any Road", which subsequently appeared on the 2002 ''Brainwashed'' album.

In January 1998, Harrison attended the funeral of his boyhood idol, [[Carl Perkins]], in [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. Harrison played an impromptu version of Perkins' song "Your True Love" during the service.<ref name="ThoughtsonCarl">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/CarlPerkins.html |title=Thoughts on Carl: Carl's Funeral |work=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref> That same year he attended the public memorial service for [[Linda McCartney]]. Also that same year, he appeared on [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Vertical Man]]'', where he played both electric and slide guitars on two tracks.

In 2001, Harrison performed as a guest musician on the Electric Light Orchestra album ''[[Zoom (ELO album)|Zoom]]''. He played slide guitar on the song "Love Letters" for [[Bill Wyman]]'s Rhythm Kings, and remastered and restored unreleased tracks from the Traveling Wilburys. He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, "[[Horse to the Water]]". The latter song ended up as Harrison's final recording session, on 2 October, just eight weeks before his death. It appeared on [[Jools Holland]]'s album ''Small World, Big Band''.<ref name="SmallWorldBigBand">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.joolsholland.com/smallworld.htm |title=Small World Big Band |publisher=Jools Holland |accessdate=30 December 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603225013/http://www.joolsholland.com/smallworld.htm |archivedate = 3 June 2008}}</ref>

Harrison's final album, ''[[Brainwashed (album)|Brainwashed]]'', was completed by [[Dhani Harrison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]] and released on 18 November 2002. It received generally positive reviews in the United States, and peaked at number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]]. A media-only single, "[[Stuck Inside a Cloud]]", was heavily played on UK and US radio to promote the album (number 27 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart), while the official single "[[Any Road]]", released in May 2003, reached number 37 on the British chart. The instrumental track, "Marwa Blues" went on to receive the [[2004 Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Instrumental Performance]], while the single "Any Road" was nominated for [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]].<ref>

===The Traveling Wilburys: 1988–1990===
{{Main|Traveling Wilburys}}
In 1988, Harrison played an instrumental role in forming the Traveling Wilburys with [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Tom Petty]] when they gathered in Dylan's garage to quickly record an additional track for a projected Harrison European single release.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=vXh8cN6ZM2sC&pg=RA1-PA129&lpg=RA1-PA129&dq=Travelling+Wilburys+dylan%27s+garage#PRA1-PA130,M1 ''Bob Dylan: Performing Artist 1986–1990 & Beyond: Mind Out of Time''] pp129-138, Paul Williams, Omnibus Press, 2004, ISBN 1-84449-281-8. Retrieved 13 December 2008.</ref> The record company realised the track ("[[Handle With Care (song)|Handle With Care]]") was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full, separate album. This had to be completed within two weeks, as Dylan was scheduled to start a tour. The album, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'', was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers (supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.). Harrison's pseudonym on the first album was "Nelson Wilbury"; he would use the name "Spike Wilbury" for the Traveling Wilburys' second album.

After the death of Roy Orbison in late 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece. Though ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]'' was their second release, the album was mischievously titled ''Vol. 3'' by Harrison. According to Lynne, "That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'"<ref>Hurwitz, Matt. "Wilburys set to travel again" ''USA Today'' 11 June 2007</ref> It was not as well received as the previous album, but did reach number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US where it went platinum, while the singles "[[She's My Baby (Traveling Wilburys song)|She's My Baby]]", "Inside Out", and "[[Wilbury Twist]]" got decent air play.

===The Beatles Anthology: 1994–1996===
{{Main|The Beatles Anthology}}
In 1994–1996, Harrison reunited with the surviving former Beatles, and Traveling Wilburys producer Jeff Lynne for ''The Beatles Anthology'' project, which included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by John Lennon in the late 1970s, as well as the lengthy interviews on The Beatles' history.<ref>Everett, ''The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver Through the Anthology'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eTkHAldi4bEC&pg=PA286 p 286].</ref> The single "[[Free as a Bird]]", was the first Beatles single since "[[The Long and Winding Road]]" in 1970.<ref name="TimeFreeBird">{{Cite news|first=Richard |last=Corliss |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,133480,00.html |title=Free as a Beatle |work=Time |date=24 June 2001|accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref><ref name="RollingStoneBeatlesBiog">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/biography |title=The Beatles' biography |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=19 February 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216002109/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/biography <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=16 February 2008}}</ref>

==HandMade Films: 1978–1994==
{{Main|HandMade Films}}
HandMade Films was a British film production and distribution company that Harrison formed in 1978 with his business partner, [[Denis O'Brien (producer)|Denis O'Brien]].<ref name="davies-85-362">Davies, ''The Beatles'' 1985, pp 362–363.</ref> It was created to help out his [[Monty Python]] friends by raising £2 million to finish their film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' after [[EMI Films]], the original financiers, pulled out due to the film's satirical content.<ref name="davies-85-362"/> Harrison took the name from some [[handmade paper]] he had been given on a mill visit.<ref name="davies-85-362"/> Though the company was formed with the intention of funding just the one film (a scenario which became epitomised as Harrison's "world's most expensive cinema ticket", as the Python's [[Eric Idle]] put it), Harrison and O'Brien bought the rights to ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'', which had been faced with various cuts, and released it in its original form.<ref>

The first film started under the company was ''[[Time Bandits]]'', equipped with a soundtrack by Harrison, in 1981, a solo project by Python [[Terry Gilliam]] for whom HandMade originally also was to finance ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' before several funding parties including HandMade dropped out of the project. Harrison produced twenty three films with HandMade, including ''[[Mona Lisa (movie)|Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'', and ''[[Withnail and I]]''. He made several [[cameo appearance]]s in these movies, including appearing as a nightclub singer in ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'' and as Mr Papadopolous in ''Life of Brian''.<ref>

</ref> Handmade Films became a rarity in the British film industry, a production company that was both consistently successful and internationally known.<ref name="davies-85-362"/><ref name="enc-culture"/> The company was well regarded both for nurturing British talent and for most of its films having British settings or inspirations.<ref name="davies-85-362"/><ref name="enc-culture">''Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture'', Peter Childs and Mike Storry, Taylor & Francis, 1999, ISBN 0-415-14726-3 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2u1yAksuT0QC&pg=PA245 pp 245–246]</ref>

Harrison was involved in some creative decisions, approving projects such as ''Withnail and I''<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IYS1iWXH5qcC&pg=PA26 ''Withnail & I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know But Were Too Drunk to Ask''], pp 26–27, Thomas Hewitt-McManus, Lulu.com, 2006, ISBN 1-4116-5821-3</ref> and visiting sets as executive producer to sort out creative problems.<ref>Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' 2006, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NRoFPFvI1joC&pg=RA1-PA243 p 243].</ref> On the whole, though, he preferred to stay out of the way: "[As a musician] I've been the person who's said of the people with the money, 'What do they know?' and now I'm that person.

==Interest in Indian culture==

===Sitar and Indian music===
During The Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend [[David Crosby]] of [[the Byrds]] introduced him to [[Indian classical music]] and the work of [[sitar]] player [[Ravi Shankar]].<ref name="shankar_intro"/> Harrison became fascinated with the instrument, immersed himself in Indian music and played a pivotal role in expanding the emerging interest in the sitar in particular and [[Music of India|Indian music]] in general in the West.<ref name="Dawn">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA172&dq=george+harrison+Monterey+Pop+Festival ''The Dawn of Indian Music in the West''], p. 172, Peter Lavezzoli, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, ISBN 0-8264-1815-5</ref>

Buying his own first sitar from a London shop called India Craft later that year (as he recalled during interviews for "The Beatles Anthology"), he played one on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' track "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]". In June 1966 Harrison met the [[sitar]] maestro [[Ravi Shankar]] at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student and was accepted.<ref name="Peter Lavezzoli 2006. p176">Peter Lavezzoli.

During the filming of the movie ''[[Help!

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' recording sessions. In 1968, Harrison travelled to [[Rishikesh]] in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].

In the summer of 1969, he produced the single "[[Hare Krishna Mantra]]", performed by the devotees of the London [[Radha]] [[Krishna]] Temple. That same year, he and fellow Beatle [[John Lennon]] met [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]]. Soon after, Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition (particularly [[Japa|''japa-yoga'']] chanting with beads), became a lifelong devotee, being associated with it until his death.<ref name = Partridge100 >{{Harvnb|Partridge|2005|p=153}}</ref>

Harrison respected people of other faiths and believed in a united holy cause; he once remarked:
{{quote|All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call. Just as cinematic images appear to be real but are only combinations of light and shade, so is the universal variety a delusion. The planetary spheres, with their countless forms of life, are naught but figures in a cosmic motion picture. One's values are profoundly changed when he is finally convinced that creation is only a vast motion picture and that not in, but beyond, lies his own ultimate reality.<ref name=about/>}}

Harrison was a devotee of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]].  The [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] [[guru]]s [[Mahavatar Babaji]], [[Lahiri Mahasaya]], [[Sri Yukteswar]], and Yogananda himself appear on the cover of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', and a quote by Harrison appears on the back cover of the Self-Realization Fellowship release of ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', Yogananda's own autobiography.

The two became close friends, with Harrison appearing on Idle's ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'' series and in his Beatles spoof, [[The Rutles]]' ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]''.<ref name="RutlandWeekendTelevision">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/rutlandweekendtelevision/index.shtml |title=Rutland Weekend Television |work=BBC |accessdate=30 December 2008}}</ref> Harrison was also parodied as a Beatle as "Stig O'Hara", portrayed by [[Rikki Fataar]]. Idle also performed the famous Monty Python sketch, "[[The Lumberjack Song]]", at the [[Concert for George]], held in 2002 to commemorate Harrison.

===Interests===
An accomplished gardener, Harrison restored the English manor house and grounds of [[Friar Park]],<ref>Greene, ''Here Comes the Sun'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BSZtZUWge-IC&pg=PA226 pp 226–227].</ref> his home in [[Henley-on-Thames]]. The house once belonged to Victorian eccentric Sir [[Frank Crisp]]. Purchased in 1970, it is the basis for the song "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)".<ref>Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' 2003, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZjY3kg2umEQC&pg=PA68 p 68].</ref> Several Harrison videos were also filmed on the grounds, including "[[Crackerbox Palace]]"; in addition, the grounds served as the background for the cover of ''All Things Must Pass''. He employed a staff of ten workers to maintain the {{convert|36|acre|m2|adj=on}} garden, and both of his older brothers worked on [[Friar Park]] as well.<ref name="davies-1985-360">Davies, ''The Beatles'' 1985, p 360.</ref> Harrison took great solace working in the garden and grew to consider himself more a gardener than a musician;<ref name="davies-1985-360"/> his autobiography is dedicated "to gardeners everywhere".<ref name="mystical">Huntley, ''Mystical One'', [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rcg50S6jLnoC&pg=PA170 p 170].</ref> Harrison also owned homes on Hamilton Island, Australia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/homes/features/2007/08/harrison_article_082007 |title=George Harrison's Haven |publisher=architecturaldigest.com |date=August 2007 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> and in [[Nahiku, Hawaii]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Helen Altonn and Gary Kubota |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2001/11/30/news/story1.html |title=George Harrison / 1943-2001 |publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com |date=30 November 2001 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref>

It also included the lyrics to his songs and some photographs with humorous captions.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0811837939 Amazon.com], reviews</ref>

Harrison had an interest in [[sports car]]s and [[motor racing]]; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the [[McLaren F1]] road car,<ref name="Cars">[http://books.google.com/books?id=iJdgbE4emBcC&pg=PA127&dq=McLaren+F1+george+harrison#PPA127,M1 ''Cars of the Super Rich''], p. 127, Martin Buckley, MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company, 2004, ISBN 0-7603-1953-7</ref> and would often attend [[Formula One]] races. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; when he was 12 he attended his first race, the [[1955 British Grand Prix]] at [[Aintree Racecourse#Motor racing|Aintree]], in which [[Stirling Moss]] won his first Grand Prix.<ref name="Cars"/><ref>

===Humanitarian Involvement===
George Harrison had an interest in humanitarian involvement even when he was a part of The Beatles. The Beatles had a strong stance on human rights, with them showing support for the civil rights movement and the protest against the Vietnam War. However, it was not until the band's split that George Harrison became more involved in humanitarian work.

Harrison's friend, [[Ravi Shankar]], consulted him regarding a means to providing help to the problems in Bangladesh, in the aftermath of the [[1970 Bhola Cyclone]] and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref name="theconcertforbangladesh1">{{cite web |url= http://www.theconcertforbangladesh.com/ |title= The Concert For Bangladesh |work= The Concert For Bangladesh |accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> With that, Harrison recorded "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]", and pushed [[Apple Records]] to release his song alongside Shankar's "Joy Bangla" in an effort to raise funds. Shankar then asked for Harrison's advice about organising a small charity concert in The United States. Harrison took that idea and called up all his friends, organising [[The Concert for Bangladesh]] on 1 August 1971 in New York City, which featured other artists of the time like [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Leon Russell]] and former Beatle [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="theconcertforbangladesh1"/> The concert ended up raising US$243,418.50.<ref>{{Cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944505,00.html |title= Cinema: Sweet Sounds |work=Time |accessdate=13 October 2011 |date=17 April 1972}}</ref>

The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for [[UNICEF]] still contributes to humanitarian efforts. The fund is a joint effort between the Harrison family and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF that aims to support UNICEF programs providing lifesaving assistance to children caught in humanitarian emergencies.<ref name="unicefusa1">{{cite web|url= http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/the-george-harrison-fund-for-u.html |title= The George Harrison Fund for UNICEF |work=UNICEF |accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> Every year, UNICEF identifies countries and territories where the children suffer from poverty.<ref name="unicefusa1"/> Much like Bangladesh in 1971, many of these problems are ignored by the media. The fund continues to support UNICEF programs in Bangladesh, while expanding its influence to include other countries in crisis where children are at risk. In December 2007, the fund made a donation of $450,000 to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF for relief and recovery efforts for the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh.<ref name="unicefusa1"/> On 13 October 2009, the first ever George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his unprecedented efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.georgeharrison.com/#/news/archive/200910/ravi-shankar-receives-first-ever-george-harrison-humanitarian-award |title= Ravi Shankar Receives First-Ever George Harrison Humanitarian Award |work=George Harrison |accessdate=13 October 2011 |date=13 October 2009}}</ref>

===Knife attack===
In late 1999, Harrison survived a knife attack by an intruder in his home.<ref>

At 3:30 am on 30 December 1999, 36-year-old Michael Abram broke into the Harrisons' [[Friar Park]] home and began loudly calling to Harrison. Harrison left the bedroom to investigate while his wife, Olivia, phoned the police. Abram attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, inflicting seven stab wounds, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a [[Fire iron#Types of fire irons|fireplace poker]] and a lamp. The attack lasted approximately 15 minutes.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=6l8b-oIs7IAC&pg=PT1&dq=ISBN+0-06-075864-3 ''The Greedy Bastard Diary: A Comic Tour of America''], pp 277–278, Eric Idle, Harper Entertainment, 2005, ISBN 0-06-075864-3</ref>
Abram, who believed he was being [[demonic possession|possessed]] by Harrison and was on a "mission from God" to kill him, was later acquitted of [[attempted murder]] [[insanity defence|on grounds of insanity]], but was detained for treatment in a secure hospital. He was released in 2002 after 19 months' detention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2096082.stm |title= Freed Beatle's attacker sorry |work=BBC News |accessdate=13 December 2008 | date=5 July 2002}}</ref>

==Illness and death==

===Cancer diagnosis===
Harrison developed [[throat cancer]], which was discovered in the summer of 1997 after a lump on his neck was analysed. He attributed it to smoking heavily from the 1960s until at least the late 1980s. He was successfully treated with [[radiotherapy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/31/world/george-harrison-stabbed-in-chest-by-an-intruder.html?pagewanted=all|title=George Harrison Stabbed in Chest by an Intruder|date=31 December 1999|newspaper=New York Times|first=Sarah| last=Lyall|accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> Early in May 2001, it was revealed that he had undergone an operation at the [[Mayo Clinic]] to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs.<ref>

On 25 November, it was reported in the ''[[Sunday People]]'' that Harrison's condition had continued to deteriorate in spite of the treatment, and that he was likely to die within days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/George_Harrison_reportedly_has_a_week_to_live/1098121 |title=George Harrison reportedly has a week to live |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=26 November 2001 |accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref>

===Lederman affair===
In a complaint later brought on behalf of Harrison's estate, it was alleged that while under the care of Staten Island University Hospital, Dr Gilbert Lederman, a radiation [[oncology|oncologist]], repeatedly revealed Harrison's confidential medical information during television interviews and forced him to autograph a guitar. The complaint alleged that Lederman and his family came uninvited to visit Harrison in the house he was staying in on the day before he was to leave for California. Lederman allegedly had his son play the guitar for Harrison. The complaint further alleged that after the performance, Lederman put the instrument on Harrison's lap and asked him to autograph it, and that Harrison responded, "I do not even know if I know how to spell my name any more." Lederman then allegedly took Harrison's hand and guided his hand along to spell his name while encouraging him by saying, "Come on, George. You can do this. G-E-O...".<ref>[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/beatles/ghldrmn10604cmp.pdf Civil Action CV040033 (NGG)] (PDF), Complaint, United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, The Estate of George Harrison v Gilbert Lederman.
